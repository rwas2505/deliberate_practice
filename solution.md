Hey Brian,

I found another discrepancy that I'm curious about in the deliberate practice.

For the solution to #8 on the [arrays_reduce_practice_reduce_solutions.rb](https://gist.github.com/peterxjang/b69183e2d555964ce3936893f423ef35), 

If you do not explicitly specify an initial value for memo, then the first element of collection is used as the initial value of memo.
